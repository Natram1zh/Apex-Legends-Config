# Read Me 🐼
- Since this is beta, you should know what you are doing
- Some number for fun like 0.333333

# ⚠️Important
- I hate Github, it gives me a lot of trouble, so I am moving to GitLab. I will try my best to sync Gitlab work with this repository but no promises.
- I am cooking a new config (No ETA) it is for absolute performance and it looks promising, at least in my case.
Reason why it took so long to reupload: I lost interest in this so...

To be up-to-date, I recommend [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/natramizh)
- Remember, No ETA
- I will upload a new config when I have peace of mind (In advance, sorry if it takes months)

# 🤝Thanks
- Thanks to the people who forked my config and kept it alive 🫡
