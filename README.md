# ‚ö†Ô∏èImportant
- I hate Github, it gives me a lot of trouble, so I am moving to GitLab. I will try my best to sync Gitlab work with this repository but no promises.
- I am cooking a new config (No ETA) it is for absolute performance and it looks promising, at least in my case.
Reason why it took so long to reupload: I lost interest in this so...

To be up-to-date, I recommend [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/natramizh)
- Remember, No ETA
- I will upload a new config when I have peace of mind (In advance, sorry if it takes months)

# ü§ùThanks
- Thanks to the people who forked my config and kept it alive ü´°

# CFG Files 
1. [Download](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.
2. Move [autoexec.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/autoexec.cfg), [superglide.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/superglide.cfg), [superglide1.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/superglide1.cfg), [superglide2.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/superglide2.cfg) and [reticles.cfg](https://github.com/Natram1zh/Apex-Autoexec-And-Tweaks-/blob/main/reticles.cfg) to the games directory cfg folder (Usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Apex Legends\cfg).
3. Rightclick on the game inside of Steam and go to "Properties".
4. Switch to the "General" Tab.
5. Add the command in launch options "+exec autoexec.cfg -dev" (without the Quotation marks).

| `-dev` | Skips EA intro on startup, can cause HUD flicker issues on NVIDIA cards |
| `-fullscreen` | Forces the game to launch in fullscreen mode |
